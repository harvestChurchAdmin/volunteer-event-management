    <h2>Scheduled events (with times)</h2>
    <ol class="muted">
      <li><strong>Create the event:</strong> Click “Create new event,” choose “Volunteer schedule,” set start/end times, and Save.</li>
      <li><strong>Add stations:</strong> Press “Add station,” give it a short name and duties. Save.</li>
      <li><strong>Add blocks:</strong> Inside the station, click “Add time block,” set Start, End, and Slots (how many people you need). Save.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep adding:</strong> Use “Add next block” to quickly stack back-to-back times, or “Reorder stations” to drag them into a better order.</li>
      <li><strong>Publish when ready:</strong> Hit “Publish” so volunteers can see it. Switch back to Draft to hide it without deleting anything.</li>
      <li><strong>Make changes:</strong> Click a slot’s “Move” to reassign, or “Add volunteer” to place someone directly. The system blocks overlapping times for the same person.</li>
      <li><strong>Share/download:</strong> Use “Actions → Printable PDF” for a simple roster or “Export” buttons for CSVs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="muted small">Tip: Short descriptions with <code>**bold**</code> keywords are easier for volunteers to scan.</p>

    <h2>Food Prep events (no times, just items)</h2>
    <ol class="muted">
      <li><strong>Create the event:</strong> Click “Create new event,” choose “Food Prep (categories & items, no times),” and Save.</li>
      <li><strong>Set categories:</strong> “Add category” for groups like Mains, Sides, Desserts. Keep descriptions short.</li>
      <li><strong>Add items:</strong> Inside a category, press “Add item.” Name it and add a “Feeds” range if you want size guidance. Save.</li>
      <li><strong>Organize:</strong> Use “Reorder categories” or “Manage → Reorder items” to drag them into the order volunteers should see.</li>
      <li><strong>Publish:</strong> Hit “Publish.” Each item counts as one slot; volunteers add dish names when they sign up.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="muted small">Tip: Use the Feeds range (e.g., 6–8) to balance how much food you get.</p>

    <h2>Common tasks</h2>
    <ul class="muted">
      <li><strong>Move a volunteer:</strong> Click “Move” on their slot, pick the new spot, and Save. Overlaps are blocked automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Adjust capacity:</strong> Click the Slots number on a station to raise or lower how many people you need.</li>
      <li><strong>Reorder:</strong> Use “Reorder stations” (or “Reorder categories”) and drag the ☰ handle. In Food Prep, open a category then “Manage → Reorder items” to drag items.</li>
      <li><strong>Close sign-ups:</strong> Switch to Draft/Private to hide the event without losing data.</li>
      <li><strong>Copy an event:</strong> “Copy event” makes a fresh Draft with the same stations/items but no volunteers.</li>
      <li><strong>Fix duplicate emails:</strong> Each email has one manage link. Use the maintenance “merge duplicates” tool if needed.</li>
